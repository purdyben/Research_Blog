Today we had an update meeting and it felt like a productive meeting. Updating Dr. Gilbert while also informing him of the progress we've made on the AI agents within the school simulation went well. After our updates were over we had a productive talk about using space syntax and its possible usages relating to this project. Im not completely sure how we'll be able to classify schools using this tool but ill have to look into it more before I know for certain.
