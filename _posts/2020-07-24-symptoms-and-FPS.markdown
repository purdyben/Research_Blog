I Attended my first VR symposium on Thursday, and it was a fun experience. Allowing me to see what others are working on from different schools and departments. The VR experience was excellent when it came to reading posters but speaking and lag were issues when people join or leave the server. I specify had issued during our presentation, voices came through as cut-up segment and static. This was one challenge that I sadly wasn't able to figure out within the time span. Overall, it was a good experience and is something that could be added to in-person presentations. 
 
update: FPS is up into the mid-thirties on my stock MacBook air, but im unable to address the unity batching problem. Also, civilians have triggered events now. This should allow us to keep track of when, where, and who escaped threw an exit.
