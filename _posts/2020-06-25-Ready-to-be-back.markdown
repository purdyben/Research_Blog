# hello, 

Coming back to everything this week is a lot. I enjoyed colorado, but im ready to tackle it my workload and made some progress. Yesterday I was able to fix the surface level issues with the state machine implementation. I am sure there will be other issues, but I got Megan to move through repeated calls to coroutines.  

Immediately, I haven't been able to make much progress on the space syntax paragraph with everything happening. Today's goal is to do some research and get something together for Dr. Gilbert.
